## Description
<p>
CustomProteinSearch is a python package containing two independent but complementary programs whose overall objective is to help users to search for specific proteins of interest based on their domain composition: <b>IterHMMBuild</b>and <b>ProSeCDA</b>.
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>IterHMMBuild</b> is an iterative search method based on the hmmer program, the aim of which is to provide users with a representative HMM protein profile of interest constructed by an iterative enrichment process starting from a small initial set of related protein sequences.
</p>

<p>
<b>ProSeCDA</b> is a tool that allows to search in a given protein database multiple proteins of interest defined by a user-specified set of domains.
</p>

## Documentation and installation
Please see our [documentation](https://nchenche.github.io/cusProSe/) for details about the package and how to [install](https://nchenche.github.io/cusProSe/installation.html) it.

Note: CusProSE is actually not supported on Windows, we'll fix this later.
